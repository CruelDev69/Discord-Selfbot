# Introduction to Voice

Voice in discord.js can be used for many things, such as music bots, recording or relaying audio.

In discord.js, you can use voice by connecting to a `VoiceChannel` to obtain a `VoiceConnection`, where you can start streaming and receiving audio.

To get started, make sure you have:

- FFmpeg - `npm install ffmpeg-static`
- an opus encoder, choose one from below:
  - `npm install @discordjs/opus` (better performance)
  - `npm install opusscript`
- a good network connection

The preferred opus engine is @discordjs/opus, as it performs significantly better than opusscript. When both are available, discord.js will automatically choose @discordjs/opus.
Using opusscript is only recommended for development environments where @discordjs/opus is tough to get working.
For production bots, using @discordjs/opus should be considered a necessity, especially if they're going to be running on multiple servers.

## Joining a voice channel

The example below reacts to a message and joins the sender's voice channel, catching any errors. This is important
as it allows us to obtain a `VoiceConnection` that we can start to stream audio with.

```js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const client = new Discord.Client();

client.login('token here');

client.on('message', async message => {
  // Voice only works in guilds, if the message does not come from a guild,
  // we ignore it
  if (!message.guild) return;

  if (message.content === '/join') {
    // Only try to join the sender's voice channel if they are in one themselves
    if (message.member.voice.channel) {
      const connection = await message.member.voice.channel.join();
    } else {
      message.reply('You need to join a voice channel first!');
    }
  }
});
```

## Streaming to a Voice Channel

In the previous example, we looked at how to join a voice channel in order to obtain a `VoiceConnection`. Now that we
have obtained a voice connection, we can start streaming audio to it.

### Introduction to playing on voice connections

The most basic example of playing audio over a connection would be playing a local file:

```js
const dispatcher = connection.play('/home/discord/audio.mp3');
```

The `dispatcher` in this case is a `StreamDispatcher` - here you can control the volume and playback of the stream:

```js
dispatcher.pause();
dispatcher.resume();

dispatcher.setVolume(0.5); // half the volume

dispatcher.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('Finished playing!');
});

dispatcher.destroy(); // end the stream
```

We can also pass in options when we first play the stream:

```js
const dispatcher = connection.play('/home/discord/audio.mp3', {
  volume: 0.5,
});
```

### What can I play?

Discord.js allows you to play a lot of things:

```js
// ReadableStreams, in this example YouTube audio
const ytdl = require('ytdl-core');
connection.play(ytdl('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlAU_w7-Xp8', { filter: 'audioonly' }));

// Files on the internet
connection.play('http://www.sample-videos.com/audio/mp3/wave.mp3');

// Local files
connection.play('/home/discord/audio.mp3');
```

New to v12 is the ability to play OggOpus and WebmOpus streams with much better performance by skipping out Ffmpeg. Note this comes at the cost of no longer having volume control over the stream:

```js
connection.play(fs.createReadStream('./media.webm'), {
  type: 'webm/opus',
});

connection.play(fs.createReadStream('./media.ogg'), {
  type: 'ogg/opus',
});
```

Make sure to consult the documentation for a full list of what you can play - there's too much to cover here!

## Voice Broadcasts

A voice broadcast is very useful for "radio" bots, that play the same audio across multiple channels. It means audio is only transcoded once, and is much better on performance.

```js
const broadcast = client.voice.createBroadcast();

broadcast.on('subscribe', dispatcher => {
  console.log('New broadcast subscriber!');
});

broadcast.on('unsubscribe', dispatcher => {
  console.log('Channel unsubscribed from broadcast :(');
});
```

`broadcast` is an instance of `VoiceBroadcast`, which has the same `play` method you are used to with regular VoiceConnections:

```js
const dispatcher = broadcast.play('./audio.mp3');

connection.play(broadcast);
```

It's important to note that the `dispatcher` stored above is a `BroadcastDispatcher` - it controls all the dispatcher subscribed to the broadcast, e.g. setting the volume of this dispatcher affects the volume of all subscribers.
